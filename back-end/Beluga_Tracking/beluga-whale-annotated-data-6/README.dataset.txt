This project focuses on developing an AI-based system to detect and track beluga whales from video and image datasets. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to analyze migration patterns, improve conservation efforts, and enhance understanding of beluga behavior.

Class Descriptions
		1. Adult Beluga Whale – Identifies mature beluga whales.
		2. Calf – Detects younger beluga whales.
		3. Unknown – Captures instances where classification is uncertain due to image quality or occlusion.
Current Status & Timeline
		1. Data Preprocessing (Ongoing) – Annotation, statistical checks, and bias analysis.
		2. Model Development (In Progress) – Training deep learning models for classification and tracking.
		3. Testing & Evaluation (Upcoming) – Performance assessment under various environmental conditions.
Resources
		1. Annotation Tools: Roboflow
		2. Data Processing: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch
		3. Storage & Compute: AWS
Contribution & Labeling Guidelines
		1. Annotations must be accurate, distinguishing adults, calves, and unknowns.
		2. Contributions should be well-documented and align with project goals.
		3. Bias Mitigation strategies should be integrated into dataset curation and model training.
